## One-Stage GANs (OSGAN)

In this work, we investigate a general training scheme that enables training GANs efficiently in only one stage. Based on the adversarial losses of the generator and discriminator, we categorize GANs into two classes, Symmetric GANs and Asymmetric GANs, and introduce a novel gradient decomposition method to unify the two, allowing us to train both classes in one stage and hence alleviate the training effort. We also computationally analyze the efficiency of the proposed method, and empirically demonstrate that, the proposed method yields a solid 1.5Ã— acceleration across various datasets and network architectures.

## Requirements

```sh
conda create -n osgan python=3.7
pip install -r requirements.txt
```



## Datasets

### 1. MNIST

Use `MNIST` class in `torchvision` to download and process MNIST and put it in `./data/`.

### 2. CelebA

Download CelebA from `http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html`.

Put aligned images of CelebA in `./data/img_align_celeba/` and run

```sh
python build_dataset.py
```



## Training

Select training dataset by editing the corresponding python scripts as follows and run it.

```sh
# ----------- Run Symmetric DCGAN (Two Stage) -----------
